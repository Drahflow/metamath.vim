# metamath.vim

This is the humble beginnings of a Vim mode for [Metamath](http://metamath.org).

For now it has only _very_ basic syntax highlighting; but it might grow source
formatting and proof formatting, and perhaps even connect to an external tool
to work as a Metamath proof assistant (just like
[`idris.vim`](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-vim) calls `idris
--client`).

## Installation

Just copy the `.vim` directory to your `$HOME/.vim` directory, keeping the
directory structure.
